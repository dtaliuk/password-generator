# Password generator

The program receives two numbers as input: the number of passwords (count) and the length of each password (length)

The program returns the passwords (each on a separate line)

#

Symbols are excluded so there's no conflict:
"l" (L is small);
"I" (i is big);
"1" (a number);
"o" and "O" (capital and small letters);
"0" (a numeral)

Additional condition: each password must contain at least one digit and at least one letter in upper and lower case.
